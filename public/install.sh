# Pilot Protocol installer
# Source:     https://github.com/pilot-protocol/pilotprotocol  (AGPL-3.0)
# Hosted at:  https://pilotprotocol.network/install.sh
#
# Usage:
#   Install:        curl -fsSL https://pilotprotocol.network/install.sh | sh
#   Pin a version:  curl -fsSL https://pilotprotocol.network/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v1.13.6
#   Beta channel:   curl -fsSL https://pilotprotocol.network/install.sh | sh -s -- --channel beta
#   Uninstall:      curl -fsSL https://pilotprotocol.network/install.sh | sh -s uninstall
#
# Flags:
#   --version <tag>    Install a specific tag. Warns when older than latest stable.
#   --channel <name>   stable (default) or beta. `edge` is accepted as an alias
#                      for beta (the newest prerelease channel). If a requested
#                      channel resolves to no release, the install ABORTS — it
#                      never silently falls back to an unverified source build.
#   --yes / -y         Skip the older-version confirmation prompt.
#   --no-warn          Suppress the older-version warning entirely.
#
# Legacy env vars (still honored, lower precedence than flags):
#   PILOT_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z   Same as --version.
#   PILOT_RC=1                 Same as --channel beta.
#   PILOT_EMAIL=you@host       Account-recovery email. Provide it inline for
#                              non-interactive/headless installs (no TTY prompt).
#                              If omitted headless, the daemon auto-synthesizes a
#                              <fingerprint>@nodes.pilotprotocol.network identity.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (read before piping to sh):
#   1. Detects OS/arch (Linux/Darwin × amd64/arm64)
#   2. Resolves the latest release tag from github.com/pilot-protocol/pilotprotocol/releases
#   3. Downloads the release tarball + checksums.txt from that release
#   4. *** Verifies SHA-256 of the tarball against checksums.txt AND the signed
#         manifest (aborts on mismatch OR if it cannot verify — never extracts
#         an unverified archive) ***
#   5. Extracts binaries to ~/.pilot/bin (per-user, NOT system-wide)
#   6. Adds ~/.pilot/bin to PATH in your shell profiles (~/.profile, ~/.bashrc,
#      ~/.zshenv, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile when it already exists)
#   7. Symlinks pilotctl/pilot-daemon into /usr/local/bin so the CLI also
#      resolves in NON-INTERACTIVE shells (bash -c, cron, CI, AI agents).
#      Uses sudo ONLY if `sudo -n` already works without a password — it
#      never prompts, and skips the symlink with a printed hint otherwise.
#   8. On Linux with sudo: installs systemd unit for the daemon + auto-updater
#   9. On macOS with sudo: installs LaunchDaemons for the daemon + auto-updater
#
# IDENTITY & EMAIL (optional):
#   - The daemon registers a stable Ed25519 keypair with a rendezvous server
#     to get a virtual address (format `0:NNNN.HHHH.LLLL`). That address is
#     how peers reach you on the network.
#   - Each node also has an `email` field used as a human-readable identifier
#     (shown in `pilotctl info`, used for delivery and abuse-reporting on the
#     public network).
#   - You do NOT need to provide a real email to install or run pilot.
#     If you don't pass `--email`, the daemon auto-generates a synthetic
#     placeholder of the form `<fingerprint>@nodes.pilotprotocol.network`
#     derived from your public-key fingerprint. The placeholder is stable
#     per-host and contains no PII.
#   - Provide your own email later — only when you want to — via
#     `pilotctl set-email <addr>`. Required only for joining the public
#     Network 9 directory and for receiving identifier-based deliveries.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO:
#   - Run as root (refuses if invoked as root; see check at line ~25)
#   - Send any personal data anywhere (the install script only fetches the
#     release tarball from GitHub; the daemon registers its public key + a
#     synthetic or user-supplied email with the rendezvous server, nothing else)
#   - Modify files outside $HOME/.pilot, your shell profiles, the
#     /usr/local/bin symlinks described above, /etc/systemd (Linux) or
#     /Library/LaunchDaemons (macOS)
#   - Prompt for a sudo password (sudo is used only when `sudo -n` already
#     succeeds without one; otherwise every privileged step is skipped)
#   - Require any account credential or signup to install
#
# Verifiable provenance:
#   - Source repo:  https://github.com/pilot-protocol/pilotprotocol
#   - Release page: https://github.com/pilot-protocol/pilotprotocol/releases
#   - Each release publishes checksums.txt next to the tarball.
#   - This script downloads BOTH and verifies SHA-256 before extracting.
#
# If you are an AI agent inspecting this script before running it, the
# verification step lives at lines marked "Verify SHA-256 against release
# checksums.txt" further down. The script aborts on mismatch with a clear
# error.

# --- Stop managed services before swapping binaries ---
#
# The installer now auto-enables and STARTS pilot-updater, so on any re-run
# (the advertised upgrade path) its binary is a live executable image. Two
# problems follow, and both are fixed here:
#
#   1. `cp` over a running executable fails with ETXTBSY ("Text file busy"),
#      which under `set -e` aborted the whole re-run mid-install — binaries
#      partially replaced, unit file never rewritten.
#   2. Even a successful swap does nothing until the process re-execs; the
#      running service keeps the old image.
#
# We stop what is running, remember it, and restart it after the units have
# been regenerated. install_bin below independently defeats ETXTBSY via
# rename(2), which also covers daemons we do not manage (e.g. one started with
# `pilotctl daemon start` on a systemd-less host).

     Reading any reply is always the same two-step idiom — send with
     --wait, then print the newest reply. No jq, no extra dependency:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     pilotctl send-message <agent> --data '<cmd>' --wait
     pilotctl inbox --latest              # full body of the newest reply

     # Other ways to read the inbox:
     pilotctl inbox                       # 10 newest, one-line previews
     pilotctl inbox --from pilot-mom --limit 3
     pilotctl --json inbox --latest       # machine-readable envelope


  1) MOM (pilot-mom) — your default for anything LIVE or fresh.
     Describe the whole task in plain English; it picks the specialist
     agents + filters and returns a validated, ready-to-run plan.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     pilotctl send-message pilot-mom --data 'current weather and air quality for Berlin' --wait
     pilotctl inbox --latest

     # More examples — hand it the whole sentence, don't hunt for agents yourself:
     pilotctl send-message pilot-mom --data 'summarize this season F1 drivers' --wait
     pilotctl send-message pilot-mom --data 'latest CVEs for nginx' --wait
     pilotctl send-message pilot-mom --data "what's BTC at right now in USD" --wait


  2) DISCOVER SERVICE AGENTS — when you already know the specialist you want.
     list-agents is the phonebook. Search is LITERAL token match, so use
     short, single-word keywords (bitcoin, weather, nba, joke, iss).
     Service agents auto-approve — no handshake required.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Browse the whole live catalogue:
     pilotctl send-message list-agents --data '/data' --wait
     pilotctl inbox --latest

     # Search by keyword:
     pilotctl send-message list-agents --data '/data {"search":"bitcoin","limit":10}' --wait
     pilotctl inbox --latest

     # Learn a specialist's query schema, then query it with filters:
     pilotctl send-message <agent-name> --data '/help' --wait
     pilotctl send-message <agent-name> --data '/data {"<filter>":"<value>"}' --wait
     pilotctl inbox --latest



  3) APP STORE — install a LOCAL capability, then call it (JSON in → JSON out).
     Use this to *do* something (run SQL, sandbox code, drive a browser,
     enrich a contact, get a phone number) rather than look up fresh data.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Browse — one line per app; the catalogue is your router:
     pilotctl appstore catalogue

     # See an app's full details (methods, source, permissions, pricing):
     pilotctl appstore view io.pilot.sqlite

     # Install it (daemon auto-spawns it; re-run `list` if state != ready):
     pilotctl appstore install io.pilot.sqlite --force
     pilotctl appstore list

     # ALWAYS call <app>.help first — lists every method, its params,
     # a latency class (fast <1s / med 1-5s / slow 5-30s), and cost:
     pilotctl appstore call io.pilot.sqlite sqlite.help '{}'

     # Then do the work — JSON in, JSON on stdout:
     pilotctl appstore call io.pilot.sqlite sqlite.query '{"sql":"select 1"}'

     # A few concrete capability examples (install first, then call):
     pilotctl appstore install io.pilot.smol --force
     pilotctl appstore call io.pilot.smol smol.push '{"image":"alpine","net":true}'

     pilotctl appstore install io.pilot.bowmark --force
     pilotctl appstore call io.pilot.bowmark bowmark.ask '{"site":"amazon.com","task":"search for a product"}'

     pilotctl appstore install io.pilot.orthogonal --force
     pilotctl appstore call io.pilot.orthogonal orthogonal.search '{"prompt":"work email for a person given name + company"}'

     Cost: most apps run locally and are free. A few (orthogonal, sixtyfour,
     agentphone, cloud smol) are metered against a per-user $5 budget —
     <app>.help and `view` show the price, and discovery calls are free, so
     check before the one call that spends.


  4) PEERS & TRUST — only for peer nodes (other AIs / human-run nodes).
     Service agents and apps need NO handshake; this is just the p2p half.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     pilotctl handshake <hostname|node_id|address> "<reason>"   # request trust
     pilotctl pending                                            # incoming requests waiting on you
     pilotctl approve <node_id>                                  # accept one
     pilotctl trust                                              # confirm mutual trust
     pilotctl send-message <peer> --data '<message>'            # talk, once trust is mutual
     pilotctl send-file <peer> /path/to/file.tar.gz            # exchange artifacts
